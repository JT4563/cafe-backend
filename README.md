# Cafe SaaS Backend (Skeleton / Production-ready comments)

This repository is a **production-focused skeleton** of the Cafe SaaS backend you requested.
It contains a full file structure, TypeScript source files with detailed comments, Prisma schema,
worker and print-service stubs, Dockerfiles, and a README that explains which files to view first.

**Important:** This is a starting point — business logic, validation, full tests, and infra secrets
must be completed and configured for your environment.

## What you get in the zip
- src/ (API server, controllers, services, routes, middleware, utils)
- prisma/schema.prisma (data model)
- worker/ (BullMQ worker)
- print-service/ (print microservice stub)
- docker-compose.yml, Dockerfiles
- README and docs explaining file chain and where to start.

## Where to start (view chain)
1. `src/server.ts` — app bootstrap, sockets, queues.
2. `src/app.ts` — express app and global middleware.
3. `src/routes/index.ts` — route registration.
4. `src/controllers/*` — controllers for each domain.
5. `src/services/*` — business logic and Prisma calls.
6. `prisma/schema.prisma` — database models (run `prisma generate`).
7. `worker/` & `print-service/` — background and printing handling.
